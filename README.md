# Customer_Fligh_informationSystem

this project focused on modeling and implementing the "Fly-Customer" system using Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and Java. The project involves the following tasks:
1. DFD Modeling: Modeled the "Fly-Customer" system using DFDs with the following details:
a. Context Diagram: Created a context diagram of the system, providing an overview of the entire system.
b. 0-DFD Diagram: Developed a level 0-DFD diagram, showcasing the main processes within the system.
c. 1-DFD Diagram: Created a level 1-DFD diagram, describing the process of synchronizing and updating flights from the Fly-Manager system, as described in the first paragraph of the frame story.
d. Data Dictionary: Compiled a data dictionary, listing all unexploded entities, flows, and processes at the lowest level (either in 1-DFD or in 0-DFD and not exploded).

2.Java Implementation: Implemented the detailed process in the 1-DFD diagram using Java.
a. Consistency: Ensured consistency between the DFD modeling and Java implementation by using matching names whenever possible. In exceptional cases, added a mapping between names in the model and names in the implementation to the data dictionary.

This project demonstrates the development of the "Fly-Customer" system by modeling it using DFDs and implementing it in Java. The DFD model provides a clear representation of the system's processes, while the Java implementation showcases the practical application of the model. The project highlights the importance of consistency between the system model and implementation for efficient system design and operation.
